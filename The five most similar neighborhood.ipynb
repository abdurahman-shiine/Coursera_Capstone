    "People move frequently from one city to another, perhaps one they have never been to before, be it for work or any other reason, and a lot of us would prefer to a place that most resembles the one they moved from, as it would be easier to adapt and live in. For this purpose, this project proposes an algorithm that measures the similarity between borough of different cities, based on their venues, and lists the most similar five boroughs in another city."
